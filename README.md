## Summary
Say goodbye to bright white screens at nightâ€”
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
No need to worry about high contrast fatigue from late night studying, document editing, and assignments: this extension introduces dark mode to common educational websites which do not have a native dark mode solution. 
  <br><br>Flashbeng contains only CSS stylesheets which are applied to the listed websites via the *manifest.json* file. To toggle off the extension, you must navigate to your browser's extension manager and manually disable it.
